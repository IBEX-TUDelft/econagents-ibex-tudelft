2. **Available Information**:
  2.1. **Declarations**:
    - Winning Condition: {{ public_information.winning_condition_description }} ({{ public_information.winning_condition }})
    {% set key = "projectA" if public_information.winning_condition == 1 else "noProject" %}
    {% for declaration in private_information.declarations %}
      {% set role_name = "Speculator" if declaration["role"] == 1 else "Developer" if declaration["role"] == 2 else "Owner" %}
      {% set declared_value = declaration["d"][public_information.winning_condition] %}
      {% if declaration["role"] == 2 %}
        {% set min_value = public_information.boundaries["developer"][key]["low"] %}
        {% set max_value = public_information.boundaries["developer"][key]["high"] %}
      {% else %}
        {% set min_value = public_information.boundaries["owner"][key]["low"] %}
        {% set max_value = public_information.boundaries["owner"][key]["high"] %}
      {% endif %}
      {% set percentile = ((declared_value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value) * 100) | round(2) %}
      - Player #{{ declaration["number"] }} ({{ role_name }}), declared value: {{ declared_value }}, percentile: {{ percentile }}%
    {% endfor %}

  2.2. **Real Value Boundaries**:
    {% for role, conditions in public_information.boundaries.items() %}
    - {{ role }}:
      {% for condition, bounds in conditions.items() %}
      - {{ condition }}: {{ bounds.low }} to {{ bounds.high }}
      {% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}

3. **Your Decision to Make**:
   - Decide which properties to purchase based on their declared values and your assessment of true value
   - You can purchase the properties of multiple players under the same condition or different conditions, choose not to buy a property, or purchase the same property under both conditions.
   - You should make a list of the id of the players whose property you want to purchase under the condition noProject: [<player_id>,<player_id>].
   - You should make a list of the id of the players whose property you want to purchase under the condition projectA: [<player_id>,<player_id>, <player_id>].
   - You should combine these two lists in a list of lists: [[<player_id>, <player_id>], [<player_id>, <player_id>, <player_id>]] and place this list of lists in the snipe field.

   - Provide the output as a JSON object:
    {
      "gameId": {{ meta.game_id }},
      "type": "done-speculating",
      "snipe": [[<player_id>, <player_id>], [<player_id>, <player_id>, <player_id>]],
    }

    Example:
    If you want to purchase the properties of player 1, 2 and 4 under the condition noProject and purchache the property of player 2 under the condition projectA, you would provide the following JSON object:
    {
      "gameId": 1,
      "type": "done-speculating",
      "snipe": [[1, 2, 4], [2]],
    }
